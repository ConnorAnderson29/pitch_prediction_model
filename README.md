# Next Pitch Prediction Model

## Business Value
The hardest part about being an MLB hitter is well.. hitting. Professional pitchers make millions of dollars by confusing
opposing hitters. As a college baseball player, I struggled with understanding how a pitcher was going to attack my weaknesses so I decided to create a model that would help predict the next pitch thrown. This product will help athletes train and find patterns in the game that were before unknown and give them confidence in their approach at the plate. It will also have value for pitchers. By showing pitchers which patterns they are likely to follow, they may be able to train around those patterns and be more effective on the mound. This would be a tool for training and could also become a tool that is used on an interactive app where fans can guess what is going to happen next.
