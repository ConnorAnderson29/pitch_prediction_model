# Next Pitch Prediction Model

## Business Understanding
The hardest part about being a MLB hitter is well.. hitting. Professional pitchers make millions of dollars by confusing opposing hitters. As a college baseball player, I struggled with understanding how pitchers were going to attack my weaknesses. This product can help athletes train and find patterns in their game that were before unknown and give them confidence in their approach at the plate. This model may also be helpful for pitchers by understanding what patterns pitchers typically follow they would be able to avoid these tendencies. 

## Data Understanding
The data will come from all MLB games played in the 2018 season. This will give me a very diverse and large pitch dataset(around 2 million pitches). The data will include all information about each individual pitch per game(including: pitch type, base runners, pitcher name, etc..)

## Data Preparation
Data is plentiful and fairly easy to retrieve so if more is needed to avoid overfitting then it will be possible to get. After my data is collected, using domain knowledge I will engineer several features that I believe are important(previous pitches, batter attributes, pitcher attributes...etc). Feature engineering will have a huge effect on the model. I am looking to paint as clear of a picture for the model as I can. 

## Modeling
Iâ€™m going to train test split 80/20 and then keep a reserve validation set of 20%. This way I can really test the accuracy of the model. Modeling will either utilize a neural network or classification models.First, I will use the data with XGBoost/Gradient Boosted trees. If those models are not successful, then the next step may be to try and train on a neural network just to see if it can produce some deep features. This may take time so I may use a cloud computing service to do the job quickly. 

## Evaluation
I will report both the accuracy score and cross entropy loss, on training and test data. I want the model to err towards fastballs. 
## Deployment
#### User Story:
My typical user will be an athlete or an avid baseball fan who is curious about how pitching tendencies influence the game. They would use my app by going  to the site, entering game information and receiving a prediction for the pitch that would most likely be thrown in that situation. The game information would include count, base runners, outs, inning, pitcher era, and hitter slugging percentage. Entering the information at first would be a hassle, especially during a fast paced game, which is why the end goal is to add a live MLB game which will constantly predict the next pitch. This way a user could enter a game, the application will call the api and the user will be able to interact with the baseball game in a new and interesting way.
